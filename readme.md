# Tic Tac Toe

This is a Tic Tac Toe game that I made for my Project Zero, as part of my Web Development Immersive 13 with General Assembly.

## Libraries
1. jQuery
2. Fontawesome

## Features
1. Choose between 2 game modes: 1 Player (vs computer) / 2 Player (vs human)
2. Choose between 3 levels of computer skill (in 1 player mode)
3. Choose tile counters ( X / O )

## How to view app
1. Play it here: http://danielmoi.github.io/ga-01-tic-tac-toe/src/
2. Clone / fork my repo: https://github.com/danielmoi/ga-01-tic-tac-toe (and open src/index.html in your browser)

## Approach
1. Players object, storing `player 1` and `player 2` objects
2. Nested array of winning combinations
3. Attach click event handlers to board squares
4. Sequential function calls to check win, update instructions, and switch turns
5. Implement computer 'AI' functionality
6. Update visual design elements
